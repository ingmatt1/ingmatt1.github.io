<!-- ======= PORTFOLIO ======= -->
    <div class="divider"></div>
        <div class = "portfolio">
            <h3>My Portfolio</h3>
            <p style="color: black;">My portfolio consists of diversification in high-growth Canadian ETFs and stocks. As the size of my portfolio increases, I look to 
            ease my way into US equities using <a href="https://www.moneysense.ca/magazine-archive/norberts-gambit-a-better-way-to-buy-u-s-dollars/" target="_blank">Norbert's Gambit. </a> 
            See items on my watchlists and stay tuned to see how my portfolio progresses!
            </p>
            <h4>iShares NASDAQ 100 ETF (XQQ)</h4>
            <p>A staple position in my portfolio moving forward. Bought in at mid to high 70s, dollar cost averaging. 
                Trimmed half at mid 80s with a fear of overconsolidation but still long. MER of 0.39% is decent. 
                Growth play but also defensive play given the environment. Gotta love it.</p>
            <h4>Bank of Montreal (BMO)</h4>
            <p>Bought in mid 60s. Trimmed half in June at mid 70s to purchase XQQ (rotate into more tech). 
                Down 40%, it was extremely discounted so first buy was easy even despite exposure to oil industry.
                Low interest rate environment will hurt long term so if I still want bank exposure, 
                I will likely move into ZWB (BMO Covered Call ETF) later since growth will be slow in coming years.</p>
            <h4>Kinaxis (KXS)</h4>
            <p>Purchased in early June off a 7% intra-day pullback in low 190s. 
                Offers cloud-based subscription software for supply chain operations. CAD tech growth play. 
                XIT probably a better position but I don't like it's lack of exposure to smaller cap names in the fund. CSU, SHOP, CGI, are too heavy.</p>
            <h4>Nextech AR Solutions Corp (NTAR)</h4>
            <p>Wins the award for my most stressful position. Augmented reality company with tremendous upside possible in their contracts with clients 
                like Ryerson University and the government of Canada. Still has the volatility of a small cap company though. 
                Larger position than I originally anticipated after a drastic 60%+ short and picking up shares as it dropped.
                Significant gains from the lows after a short squeeze following the release of preliminary Q2 earnings but still looking to trim some of my position if it hits 
                double digits.
                </p>

<!-- ======= WATCHLIST ======= -->
            <div class="divider"></div>
                <div class="watchlist">
                    <h3>Stock Watchlist</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom:30px;font-style:italic;">All CAD stocks. Preference towards high growth names.</p>

                    <li><a>KXS</a>: consistently beats earnings estimates but has run up. Buy possible dip after Q2 or Q3 earnings.</li>
                    <li><a>OTEX</a>: less volatile CAD tech but analysts offer upside on good price targets.</li>
                    <li><a>BAM</a>: fantastic management. Great value buy before Q2 earnings. Price targets favourable at mid 45.</li>
                    <li><a>SHOP</a>: FB and Walmart deals are the start of big things to come but tough valuation to swallow now.</li>
                    <li><a>CSU</a>: quiet company with potential for huge upside acquisitions in this environment.</li>
                    <li><a>ENB</a>: high dividend yield with extensive infrastructure. Pipeline based so less exposure to oil prices.</li>
                    <li><a>GOOS</a>: recovery play with oppurtunity in China. Concerns with CAD CHINA tensions though.</li>
                    <li><a>CIBC</a>: large housing exposure has hurt value but could help value now if quick recovery. High yield too.</li>
                    <li><a>AC</a>: rough earnings, government been of no help, but can't ignore upside of this recovery play. </li>
                    <li><a>ARHT</a>: small cap, good diversification in AR space with NTAR. High risk, high reward.</li>
                    <li><a></a>: </li>

                    <div class="divider"></div>

                    <h3>ETF Watchlist</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom:30px;font-style:italic;">The less exciting of the 2 watchlists. However, Questrade offers free ETF buying so I've been loving the ability to 
                        dollar cost average into positions I like on both the value and growth sides.</li>
                    <li><a>ZEB</a>: CAD banks offer good upside potential with a great yield. Again, low interests rates remain a concern so more of a short term value play.</li>
                    <li><a>ZWB</a>: covered call option for CAD banks offers a good long term strategy given the interest rate environment and a huge yield. Likely a good option in the coming months.</li>
                    <li><a>XFN</a>: alternative to equal weighted (ZEB, ZWB) and offers some exposure (though minimal) to other finance companies (BAM, MFC, etc.). 
                        Good if you like top holdings of (RY, TD, BNS).</li>
                    <li><a>XIT</a>: pull back after or before Q2 earnings could be enticing. Solid companies but high valuations now. 
                        Great play into 2021 as CAD tech emerges as a new leader out of the pandemic.</li>
                    <li><a>XQQ</a>: Anti-trust concerns and China tensions are on the rise. Likely overconsolidation in tech so a dip would be healthy. 
                        Short term: rangebound volatility, Medium term: lag the S&P 500, Long term: outperform S&P 500.</li>

                <h3>Podcasts</h3>
                <p><a>Canadian Investor</a>: Focus on Canadian investing but still explores the US because of Canada's close relationship with the US. 
                    Offers information for both beginner and advanced investors. Generally release content weekly.</p>
                <p><a>InvestTalk</a>: US investing podcast. Very active so great for keeping up with regular news. However, one part I don't like is how people call in for 
                    advice and ask specific questions to their stock in question.</p>
