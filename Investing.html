            <h2>Investing</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my investing page! Here, I share my favourite investing resources and offer advice for young traders. Check out some of the stocks and ETFs on my watchlist. Disclosure: I am not a licensed finance professional.</p>
        
        <div class = "portfolio">
            <h3>My Portfolio</h3>
            <p style="color: black;">My portfolio consists of diversification in high-growth Canadian ETFs and stocks. As the size of my portfolio increases, I look to 
            ease my way into US equities using <a href="https://www.moneysense.ca/magazine-archive/norberts-gambit-a-better-way-to-buy-u-s-dollars/" target="_blank">Norbert's Gambit. </a> 
            See items on my watchlists and stay tuned to see how my portfolio progresses!
            </p>
            <h4>iShares NASDAQ 100 ETF (XQQ)</h4>
            <p>A staple position in my portfolio moving forward. Bought in at mid to high 70s, dollar cost averaging. 
                Trimmed half at mid 80s with a fear of overconsolidation but still long. MER of 0.39% is decent. 
                Growth play but also defensive play given the environment. Gotta love it.</p>
            <h4>Bank of Montreal (BMO)</h4>
            <p>Bought in mid 60s. Trimmed half in June at mid 70s to purchase XQQ (rotate into more tech). 
                Down 40%, it was extremely discounted so first buy was easy even despite exposure to oil industry.
                Low interest rate environment will hurt long term so if I still want bank exposure, 
                I will likely move into ZWB (BMO Covered Call ETF) later since growth will be slow in coming years.</p>
            <h4>Kinaxis (KXS)</h4>
            <p>Purchased in early June off a 7% intra-day pullback in low 190s. 
                Offers cloud-based subscription software for supply chain operations. CAD tech growth play. 
                XIT probably a better position but I don't like it's lack of exposure to smaller cap names in the fund. CSU, SHOP, CGI, are too heavy.</p>
            <h4>Nextech Ar Solutions Corp (NTAR)</h4>
            <p>Wins the award for my most stressful position. Tremendous upside possible in their contracts with clients like Ryerson University and the government of Canada but 
                still has the volatility of a small cap company. Larger position than I originally anticipated after a drastic 60%+ short and picking up shares as it dropped.
                Significant gains from the lows after a short squeeze following the release of preliminary Q2 earnings but still looking to trim some of my position if it hits 
                double digits.
                </p>
            
            
        
            <h3>Stock Watchlist</h3>
            <p>KXS: consistently beats earnings estimates but has run up. Buy possible dip after Q2 or Q3 earnings.</p>

            <p>BAM: fantastic management. Great value buy before Q2 earnings. Price targets favourable at mid 45.</p>
            <p>SHOP: FB and Walmart deals are the start of big things to come but tough valuation to swallow now.</p>
            <p>CSU: quiet company with potential for huge upside acquisitions in this environment. </p>

            <h3>ETF Watchlist</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom:40px;">The less exciting of the 2 watchlists. However, Questrade offers free ETF buying so I've been loving the ability to 
                dollar cost average into positions I like on the value and growth sides. </p>
            <p>ZEB: </p>
            <p>XIT: pull back after or before Q2 earnings could be enticing. Solid companies but high valuations now. 
                Great play into 2021 as CAD tech emerges as a new leader out of the pandemic</p>
            <p>XQQ: Anti-trust concerns and China tensions are on the rise. Likely overconsolidation in tech so a dip would be healthy. 
                Short term: rangebound volatility, Medium term: lag the S&P 500, Long term: outperform S&P 500</p>
